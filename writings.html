                                <p>My scientific work has focused on building and using computation as a tool for measuring, quantifying, interpreting data, and ultimately using simple models to understand complex biological systems. The common thread of my work has been the construction of computational and statistical tools that enable the collection of data and testing of various biological hypotheses rather than commitment to a hypothesis or single domain.</p>
                                
                                <p>One more note: the ideas and execution of these projects were shared among a wide group of highly talented colleagues and interlocutors from multiple institutions. I am grateful to be considered their peer and to have contributed in part to their work. Where available, I've linked the PubMed version of each article.

                                    <b>Toward developing automatic control of unconsciousness during anesthesia. </b>
                                    Anesthesia is a reversible state of unconsciousness, amnesia, and immobility with a reduced sensitivity to painful stimuli. Anestheisia is a primary reason modern surgery is humane, and is a very safe process. Still, some patients, particularly older adults, are susceptible to disorders following anesthesia such as postoperative cognitive dysfunction. It's thought that reducing anesthetic exposure during surgery might reduce these side effects, while it's also important to ensure consistent unconsciousness. For these two reasons, it is desirable to build automated or semi-automated systems to aid in anesthetic dosing. The brain produces reliable electrical patterns in response to changes in state including, sleep, seizures, coma, and anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. Anesthesiologists have learned to read unprocessed EEG and EEG spectra during anesthetic delivery to ensure unconsciousness. We developed a <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8101756>simple machine learning classification model using EEG spectra</a> during propofol anesthesia in healthy volunteers, and found that it generalized well to propofol anesthesia in the OR as well as sevoflurane anesthesia, likely due to a shared mechanism of action. We also developed wrote a <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8222661>review on burst-suppression EEG patterns</a>, which appear during higher anesthetic doses or medical coma.

                                    <b>Toward the discovery of circadian rhythms in the malaria parasite. </b>Malarial infection is characterized by hallmark periodic fevers, which typically occur in multiples of 24h. This implies that there may be a circadian regulatory mechanism underlying the generation of the rhythm, though that rhythm may originate with the host (and thus drive the parasite rhythm) or originate with the parasite itself. The Takahashi and Rijo-Ferreira labs sought to determine where this rhythm originated by studying transcriptional and life cycle rhythms of the parasite in host mice with genetic alterations to the mouse circadian rhythm. We found that parasite rhythms were sustained in the absence of mouse rhythms, and that they could entrain to non-24h mouse rhythms; in sum, we found that <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7409452>malaria parasites have a circadian clock</a>.

                                    <b>Computational and modeling approaches for understanding circadian rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. </b>It is estimated that between 10 and 20% of mammalian gene expression is under circadian regulation. Most cells in the mammalian body are though to exhibit autonomous near-24h entrainable (i.e., circadian) oscillation in gene expression and metabolism. Circadian rhythms are aligned across the body by several pacemakers, one of which resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where around 20,000 neurons align genetic oscillations to light inputs and to each other by the exchange of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. We were interested in many properties of this system including <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6085153>the role of neural firing in neuropeptide release and synchrony</a>, <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5815340>the onset of circadian oscillation during development</a>, <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843423>the functional network structure during synchronization</a>, and <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8265161>the roles of neronal subpopulations in circadian synchrony</a>. This research was conducted in collaboration with the Herzog and Takahashi labs. I would broadly summarize these results by saying that we found (1) the SCN network is highly heterogeneous and there is no single "essential constituent molecule" driving synchrony; and (2) neural firing plays a critical and under-appreciated role in network function. It is challenging to assess the subtle effects of each neuropeptide or transmitter on excitability in the connected network, and formulating hypotheses requires a mathematical framework for understanding what you're testing.

                                    <b>Toward pharmaceutical-induced control of circadian rhythms. </b>Controlling circadian rhythms could reduce the health burdens of shift workers or be used to time the delivery of therapeutics that have targets under circadian regulation. The circadian system is also an interesting case for control because applying the same inputs at different times can drive diametrically opposing effects. We studied the properties of a control system for circadian rhythms including <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822617>model-predictive control</a> and <a href=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67068-3_9>simple methods for control of oscillator populations while maintaining synchrony</a>.</p>

                                As part of our work regarding circadian synchrony, we developed Python tooling for performing discrete stochastic simulations. The relatively primitive software described in <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473341>our original paper</a> has since been dramatically improved by the Drawert lab: <a href=https://github.com/StochSS/GillesPy2>GillesPy2</a>.</p>

                                <p>My scientific work has focused on using computation and mathematical theory as a tool for measuring, quantifying, and ultimately understanding complex biological systems. The unifying thread therefore is in the methods and theory behind the work rather than the domain in which computational tools are applied. In this I aspire to be like Brahe as much as Kepler. While Kepler put forth an elegant system of laws that governs the motion of the heavenly bodies, he was only able to make these inferences using data collected by the technological and computational advances of Brahe. I don't aim to pretend that anything I've worked on is as meaningful, though.</p>
                                
                                <p>One more note: the ideas and execution of these projects were shared among a wide group of highly talented colleagues and interlocutors from multiple institutions. I am grateful to be considered their peer and to have contributed in part to their work.</p>

                                    <b>Toward the discovery of circadian rhythms in the malaria parasite. </b>Malarial infection is characterized by hallmark periodic fevers, which typically occur in multiples of 24h. This implies that there may be a circadian regulatory mechanism underlying the generation of the rhythm, though that rhythm may originate with the host (and thus drive the parasite rhythm) or originate with the parasite itself. The Takahashi and Rijo-Ferreira labs sought to determine where this rhythm originated.

Our study spanned

The circadian system is also an interesting case because applying the same inputs at different times can drive diametrically opposing effects. We studied the properties of such a control system including [model-predictive control] and [simple control of oscillator populations].</p>
